# Threshold-of-Thoughts
A representation of the effect of polarization in our view of the real world

When you open the `index.html` file, you will see the original image in black and white and unchanged. There is a slider on this page where you can set the desired threshold for pixels to be set to black or white. In each pixel, if the number is greater than the threshold, it becomes white, if it is smaller than the threshold, it becomes black.

With the help of this representation, you will be able to see the effect of polarization of thoughts on the real situation of an issue. You can see how much polarization destroys the details of the real world and presents us a wrong picture of the world. Most of this code is generated by `ChatGPT` and a small part has been modified.

Here is the image before setting threshold :
